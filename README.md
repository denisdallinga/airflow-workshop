# airflow-workshop

## Improvements:
* Work with docker images with preinstalled airflow, installing during the workshop takes too much time
* Either don't go over the additional functionality topics before the workshop, or reserve 1 sheet per functionality, or explain the functionality while doing the workshop
* Provide the code examples. Typing, explaining and debugging this stuff takes too much time for what needs to be done
* Place functions in separate modules, good oportunity to introduce the `.airflowignore` file too.
